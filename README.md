BFBB - Backwards

To install; Drag and drop the hb folder into your extracted game files and replace all files. Do the same with sb.ini

This mod starts you out in the 3rd Hub area and you complete the levels in reverse order. 
As soon as you spawn you need to either go to dream to be able to get back into hub 3, or go into the chum bucket to unlok that warp. (talking to Mr krabs is also an option)
